## Mission
To facilitate the growth of bitcoin culture in local neighbourhoods.

Not in a particular order, we value:
- Bitcoin as sound money technology
- Free and Open Source Software
- Privacy
- Self-sovereignty
- Education

## Guiding Documents
The following documents guide the actions of unspent projects:
- Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto [source](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
- Cypherpunk Manifesto by Eric Hughes [source](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/cypherpunk-manifesto/)

## Design Principles
These are the guiding principles that unspent spaces should incorporate when designed. 

### Unspent space
The space should be significantly unused, neglected or disregarded, and not necessarily highly regarded. This does not mean it can't be in a central location, but it should be a space that is looking for a little bit of love.

### Privacy
When designed the physical environment for the space and also the logistics for how members interact with the space, privacy should be forefront of mind. For example, where possible, avoid members having to dox themselves more than they already need to. Instead of accepting membership payments via fiat rails online, you can accept bitcoin, cash or trade space time for a helpful hand.

Another example of where privacy can be maintained is ensuring adherance to respecting the space by using a multi-sig account for bond, rather than using surveillance inside the building.

### Free and Open Source Software
Where-ever possible, try to incorporate free and open source software for all activities. For example, rather than paying for a booking software, use an open source repository for building this.
